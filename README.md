# Multi-class-Dog-Breed-Classification
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

 ## 1. Problem
 > Identify the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

 ## 2. Data
 > Data Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data

 ## 3. Evaluation
> The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

Evaluation Link: www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation

## Features
> Some information about the data:
* W're dealing with images (unstructured data) so its best to use deep learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (i.e there are 120 different classes)
* There aare 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have label)
* There are  10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels)
